# Tutorial 1

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development.

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to introduce interactivity into our websites.
- to learn the basics of javascript.
- to understand buttons, inputs, and their subsequent browser events.

## Assignment:

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. **NOTE**: It can take up to 10 minutes for pushed up code to appear in a deployed site. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://interactivedatavis2021.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your commited code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the 12pm the day of the next class.
