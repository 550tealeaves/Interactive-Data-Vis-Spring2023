# Section 1 | Tutorial 2 | Basic HTML

This introductory tutorial section will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development.

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to learn what HTML elements are available to us in basic web development, including divs, tables, and svgs. 
- to get a basic understanding of css and selectors, and how they can be used to style a page.
- to ground ourselves in the Document Object Model.

## Assignment:

- [ ] Make your own [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) with different data, either real or made up. For full credit, this table **must**:
  - [ ] have at least one more column than the sample code
  - [ ] have more rows than the sample code
- [ ] Create and style a new CSS class that corresponds to your new data, similar to the sample code. 
- [ ] Change the [circles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle) we built in class to [rectangles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect). For reference you can use the MDN documentation for svg rectangles.  
- [ ] Push these changes up to your forked repository. You should see your commit and any code changes in the github repo. Confirm that you see your changes in the deployed site. Follow the details outlined in the [deploy and submit below](#deploy--submit) to recieve credit.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Add a path to your SVG. Use the [MDN documentation on paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path) to help you build a function to illustrate those paths. 
- [ ] Add an image to your page using image tags (`<img />`). 
- [ ] Add a button or input to your page. 

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. **NOTE**: It can take up to 10 minutes for pushed up code to appear in a deployed site. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://interactivedatavis2021.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your commited code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the 12pm the day of the next class.
