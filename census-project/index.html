    <h3>What does the financial picture tell us about men and women in the United States?</h3>
    <p>Using the 2021 5 year estimate from <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2021_5yr/R13363886">Social
            Explorer</a>, we can see some interesting patterns that paint the financial picture of men and women in the US.
    </p>
    <small>Note about the data - although sex is collected as binary data in the Census, it may not accurately represent how
        many feel about their gender.</small>
